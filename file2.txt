File Handling

Operations-
1. Open File using some specific modes
2. read/write
3. Close File

Modes-
1. Read - r  ->  File should exist
2. Write - w -> File will be created if not found, if file is found existing data will be deleted (truncate)
3. Append - a -> File will be created if not found, if file is found, data will be written at the end without overriding or deleting any data
4. r+ (read and write) -> read has more priority for us -> file should exist -> overriding will happen at the time of write
5. w+ (write and read)
6. a+ (append and read)

Binary file-
1. rb
2. wb
3. rb+
4. wb+
